    course: Bachelor of Science Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
    university: Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology
    description: “You do not get what you want; you get what you go for.” This four-month training program at icipe has been a journey of great transformation and growth, courtesy of the outstanding trainers; Dr. Caleb Kibet, Ms. Ruth Nanjala, and Mr. Nehemiah Ongeso. The state-of-the-art facilities at icipe and the collaboration between interns made the training very transformative and impactful. The training opened my mind and enabled me to broadly understand bioinformatics and appreciate its roles and applications to other science disciplines. As a health-science research enthusiast, the program helped me answer the question “Why bioinformatics?” and has streamlined my career path and vision. Interestingly, the program enabled me to “learn how to learn." The mentorship part of the program has been very enlightening and has prepared me professionally to be who I want to be. Moreover, this was an excellent opportunity to interact, share our different ideas, and learn from the like-minded teams at icipe.

    course: Bachelor of Science Genomics
    university: Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology
    description: The bioinformatics internship at icipe was a game changer for me, as it helped lay the foundation for my career. It was a valuable and enlightening experience. I had the opportunity to work with a talented team of researchers, collaborate with my fellow peers who are brilliant scientists, and solve real-world problems using technology. I learned a great deal about the current state of the field and the various techniques used to analyze and interpret large sets of biological data. I also gained valuable experience in programming, data analysis, scientific communication, and how high-performance computing works and is configured. Our supervisors were very friendly and eager to help when we got stuck. Overall, I am grateful for the opportunity the MBBU team gave me to gain hands-on experience in bioinformatics. I am excited to apply what I've learned in my future endeavors.

    description: My tenure at ICIPE pervaded me with a plethora of learning experiences that equipped me with the necessary skills to handle practical bioinformatic scenarios. These same skills have helped pave the way for the next steps in my professional agenda. The MBBU staff walked my fellow cohorts and me through extensive training and mentorship modules that shaped certain aspects of how I think when tackling problems. With a strong emphasis on collaboration, working on various projects in teams enabled us to identify strengths amongst ourselves, fostering a smooth and healthy working environment in the office. It was an honour to be part of the 6th cohort at ICIPE.

    
projects:
  - name: Metabarcoding-of-Rumen-Microbiome
    description: This Project aims to establish rumen microbiome diversity and variation between cattle, camels, goats and sheep. Genomic rumen microbiome DNA was isolated and characterized using bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA, protozoal 18S rRNA genes and fungal ITS1 gene amplicons sequencing from the harvested bovine rumen fluid samples using next-generation sequencing technology.
